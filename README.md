## Neural Network Architecture Visualization
# Overview
This Python script utilizes Matplotlib to create a visual representation of a neural network architecture. The architecture is defined by layers and nodes, and connections between them are illustrated using scatter plots.

# Purpose
The script aims to generate a visual depiction of a neural network specified by the 'layerList' variable. It produces scatter plots to depict connections between nodes in different layers.

# Input
The neural network architecture is described by the layerList variable, where each layer is represented by a list of node values. The script then generates scatter plots to illustrate connections between nodes in distinct layers.


# Output
The script generates a PNG image file named "neuralNetworks.png" that visually represents the specified neural network architecture.

## How to Use
Install Matplotlib using pip install matplotlib.
Run the script.
Note: This script is designed for educational purposes and may require customization for different network structures.
